Simulation files for the paper "A message passing approach for decision fusion of hidden-markov observations in the presence of synchronized attacks" published at Int. Conf. Advances in Multimedia (MMEDIA), Special Track on Models and Algorithms for Spatially and Temporally Correlated Data (STCD).

Main_sim_turbo_synch_biz_improved.m: to setup the simulation parameters and run the experiments.
The rest of the files are to calculate the messages exchanged over the factor graph and setup the Markovian observations under synchronized and unsynchronized attacks.
The synchronized attacks files can be distinguished by the extension "synch" in the file name.
